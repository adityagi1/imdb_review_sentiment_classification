# IMDB Review Sentiment Analysis 

This repo contains my sentiment analysis project for the IMDB movie review dataset for the Fellowship.ai application, as well as a follow up topic modelling analysis. 

To run the code, please open the jupyter notebook `imdb_sentiment_classification.ipynb`. Alternatively, you can also directly view the generated notebook as an .html file (`imdb_sentiment_classification.ipynb`) 

You may view my application video [here] (https://youtu.be/b4jfCEq7SLQ).
